* Winding number

One of the way to test if a point in $R$ is in a polygon is use an algorithm called
winding number. The idea is to draw from each point of the vertices of the polygon $P$
to the point $R$ and calculate the sum, called the winding number,
$\sum \angle (RP_i, RP_{i+1})$. If the sum is zero, then the point is outside the
polygon, otherwise it is inside.

However, calculuating the sum of the angle is costly, and there is a better
way to get around it. For each vertices of a polygon, there is a natural
association to the number 0,1,2,3 called the quadrant relative to the test point $R$.

And for each consecutive vertices, we calculate the difference of their quadrant,
and then we sum all the these number, that gives us the winding number.

Formally, $w = \sum \delta_i$ where

| quad(p_{i+1}) - quad(p_i) | \delta_i |
|---------------------------+----------|
| 0                         |        0 |
| 1 or -3                   |        1 |
| -1 or 3                   |       -1 |
| 2 or -2 ccw               |        2 |
| 2 or -2 cw                |       -2 |

If $w=0$ then $R$ is outside; and $R$ is inside if $w$ is non zero.

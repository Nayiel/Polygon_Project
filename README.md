# Polygon_Project
This project aim to dertermine by twos differents methods if a given point is in a given polygon or not. 
The idea of the first method, is to cast a infinite line from the given point and count the number of time it cross the polygon. If is an even number, the point does not belong to the polygon and if it is odd, the point belongs to it. This is the method so called scanline or ray casting.
